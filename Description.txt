Hello!

I have made an online shopping  page using jQuery.

The page has a Slider with images, these images are generated using the JSON txt file that you have provided me with.

I have made some modifications to the file so I can include more stuff.

On click the "Details Button",  it will generate elements that will present a Pop up page and there will be a second slider there with all the Details for the given product.


I have made my project Using Visual Studio Code and for localhost, I have used a Live Server given from the VSC.
